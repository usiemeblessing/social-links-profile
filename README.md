## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

-   How to structure a simple component using semantic HTML

-   Using Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally

-   Applying consistent spacing, font styles, and colors based on a design

-   Making a layout responsive for different screen sizes

-   Improving attention to detail by closely matching a given design
-   Working with design assets and style guides.

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to keep improving my skills in responsive design, especially using mobile-first workflows. I also plan to explore adding basic interactivity with JavaScript in future projects and focus more on accessibility best practices to make my components more user-friendly.

### Useful resources
